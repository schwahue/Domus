# Output values make information about your infrastructure available on the command line, and can expose information for other Terraform configurations to use.
# Output values are similar to return values in programming languages.

# Example
# output "db_password" {
#   value       = aws_db_instance.db.password
#   description = "The password for logging in to the database."
#   sensitive   = true
# }
